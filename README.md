# Introduce
It's a fuse plugin, and it can virtual merges files, and virtual replaces bytes.

when system read this file, it output the merged/replaced content of many really files that you set.

But it's not a really merged file, it only output the merged content when you use `fread pread, even md5...` in linux.

So, you can save so many disk space.

> the code is based by https://github.com/schlaile/concatfs, Thanks!

**Example**

create `/the/src/dir/`1.txt

```text
12345678
```

create `/the/src/dir/`2.txt

```text
abcdefghi
```

create a file named `/the/mounted/dir/`1-merged-.txt,

`-merged-` is a special words in the file name, and the content is

**JSON format**
```json
[
    {
        "path": "1.txt"
    },
    {
        "path": "2.txt"
    }
]
```

`cat /the/mounted/dir/1-merged-.txt`, output:

```text
12345678abcdefghi
```

So it virtual merges two files, with a json, and output the merged content when reading.

> Of course, this plugin builds for **BIG SIZE** files. eg: `mkv, mp4`,
>
> Or so many **BIG SIZE** copies with a few difference. eg: program copies(with different biz channel ID)

# FEATURES
- Runs in userspace (FUSE);
- Files with the string `-merged-` anywhere in the filename are considered concatenation description special files;
- JSON format;
- Save disk space;
- Virtual merge files;
- Virtual replace file's content.
- Auto mount in fstab at Boot

# Install
It needs GCC 4.9, [Install GCC 4.9 in CentOS 6/7](#install-gcc-49-in-centos-67)

> modern C++ 11

```bash
yum install fuse fuse-devel

cd merged-fuse
make
make install
```

Uninstall
```
make uninstall
```

# Usage
## Directories
It's a FUSE plugin, so it uses two directories:
- source dir
- be mounted dir

```bash
mkdir /the/src/dir
mkdir /the/mounted/dir
```

You can **Write** your `-merged-` file at source dir

And **Read** your `-merged-` file at mounted dir after `merged-fuse` or `fstab`

## Run in background
```bash
merged-fuse /the/src/dir/ /the/mount/dir/
```
## Run in debugging

> see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.fuse.8.html
> https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs135.201109/homework/fuse/fuse_doc.html#other-options

```
merged-fuse /the/src/dir/ /the/mount/dir/ -d
```

## Run in other user
create your config to  `/etc/fuse.conf`

> see http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/mount.fuse.8.html

```
user_allow_other
```
run with user 'apache' and allow other user read/write
```
sudo -u apache merged-fuse /the/src/dir/ /the/mount/dir/ -o allow_other
```

## Stop
```bash
umount /the/mounted/dir/
```

## Register to fstab
To have the pool mounted at boot or otherwise accessable from related tools use `/etc/fstab.`
```bash
# <file system>    <mount point>     <type>            <options>             <dump>  <pass>
 /the/src/dir      /the/mounted/dir  fuse.merged-fuse  defaults,allow_other  0       0
```

# Methods

## MERGE
Write at src dir
```bash
/the/src/dir/game.of.thrones-merge-.mp4
```

```json
[
    {
        "path": "1.mp4"
    },
    {
        "path": "2.mp4"
    },
    {
        "path": "3.mp4"
    }
]
```
Read at mounted dir

```bash
/the/mounted/dir/game.of.thrones-merge-.mp4
```

## REPLACE
Write at src dir
```bash
/the/src/dir/1-merge-.zip
```

- offset [long long]: may Â±, current file's offset,

    If **offset** is negative, it will seeking from the end of file

    If **offset** is out of file, return error.

- length [short]: max value is 1024

    If **length** is greater than the offset to the end of file,
    it's fine, the replaced content will be truncate, and it'll not overflow.


- content [string]: BASE64, the repleaced content(supported Binary)

    If **BASE64 DECODED Content**'s size is less than **length**, return error.

```json
[
    {
        "path": "1.zip",
        "replaces": [
            {
                "offset": 10,
                "length": 4,
                "content": "NDMyMQ=="
            },
            {
                "offset": -2,
                "length": 2,
                "content": "MjE="
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "path": "2.text"
    }
]
```
Read at mounted dir

```bash
/the/mounted/dir/1-merge-.zip
```

# Permission
## fuse: failed to exec fusermount: Permission denied

change `/dev/fuse`'s group to fuse

```shell
chgrp fuse /dev/fuse
```

add your user to fuse's group, e.g. `nobody`, `apache`

```bash
usermod -a -G fuse root
usermod -a -G fuse nobody
usermod -a -G fuse apache
```

## fusermount: user has no write access to mountpoint `/your/mounted/dir/`

change your dir's user/group to who merged-fuse running, eg: `apache`

```
chown apache:apache /your/mounted/dir/
```
